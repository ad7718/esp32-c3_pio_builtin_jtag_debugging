# Driver for the FT2232H JTAG chip on the Espressif Kaluga-1 ESP32-S2 board
# (and most other FT2232H and FT232H based boards)
#
# JTAG DIP switch (labelled SW5 in the schematic) should be "ON" for lines
# labelled TCK, TDO, TDI and TWS, to connect the FT2232H to the ESP32-S2.

# The speed of the JTAG interface, in KHz. If you get DSR/DIR errors (and they
# do not relate to OpenOCD trying to read from a memory range without physical
# memory being present there), you can try lowering this.
#
# On ESP32-S2, this can go as high as 20MHz if CPU frequency is 80MHz, or 26MHz
# if CPU frequency is 160MHz or 240MHz.
